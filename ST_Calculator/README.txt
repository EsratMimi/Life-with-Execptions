During my undergrad I was a Student Tutor where we used to pay hourly basis. For getting the full salary there was a threshold hours I need to work.
We used punch card for entry and exists but the total hour count was a manual thing.
I hate to calculate the time manually so I do some code where I give the hours and get the total hours back

So I did this for making my easier!

Cheers to the easy life!
